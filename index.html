        <p class='card-text'>
          I love cooking a variety of dishes including East Asian, Indian, American, Italian, and Latin American. I learned my skills mainly through watching Youtube recipe videos.

          Gardening
        </h3>
        <p class='card-text'>

        <p class='card-text'>
          Music has been my biggest passion all my life. Having the best time of my life singing in choirs and musicals, I pursued a Music Therapy and Voice major in college. I also play piano and acoustic guitar.
